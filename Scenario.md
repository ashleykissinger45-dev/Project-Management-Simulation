# Project Scenario: Smart Task & Risk Dashboard

## Background

TechFlow Solutions is a mid-sized software consulting company with 250 employees managing multiple client projects simultaneously. Currently, project managers use a combination of Excel spreadsheets, Jira, and email to track tasks, deadlines, resource allocation, and project risks. This fragmented approach has led to:

- **Missed deadlines**: 23% increase in deadline overruns in Q4 2025
- **Resource conflicts**: Double-booking of developers across three projects in December
- **Risk oversight**: Two critical risks in the PaymentPro project were not escalated until they became issues
- **Reporting delays**: Senior management receives project status updates 3-5 days after sprint completion
- **Data inconsistency**: Task status in Jira often doesn't match resource allocation in Excel

The PMO Director has identified the need for a centralized, real-time dashboard that provides a single source of truth for project tracking and risk management.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**  
Project managers spend 6-8 hours per week manually consolidating data from multiple systems to create status reports. There is no real-time visibility into task progress, resource utilization, or risk exposure across projects. Critical information is siloed, leading to reactive rather than proactive project management.

**Desired State:**  
Project managers and stakeholders should have instant access to current project health through a unified dashboard that automatically updates task status, flags resource conflicts, highlights high-priority risks, and enables data-driven decision-making.

**Impact of Not Solving:**
- Continued project delays affecting client satisfaction (current NPS: 52, target: 75+)
- Increased project manager burnout (60% report spending too much time on administrative tasks)
- Potential revenue loss from missed project milestones ($150K penalty clause triggered twice in 2025)
- Competitive disadvantage as clients expect real-time project transparency

## Business Need

This dashboard is critical for TechFlow's 2026 strategic initiative to improve operational efficiency and client delivery excellence. The company is bidding on a major enterprise client contract worth $2M annually that requires real-time project visibility as a prerequisite.

**Key Drivers:**
1. **Efficiency**: Reduce PM administrative time by 40%
2. **Visibility**: Provide real-time project health metrics to leadership
3. **Risk Management**: Proactive risk identification and mitigation
4. **Client Satisfaction**: Demonstrate transparency and control to clients
5. **Scalability**: Support company growth from 15 to 25 concurrent projects

---

## Opportunity

- **Market Position**: Position TechFlow as a data-driven, transparent consulting partner
- **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiate from competitors who rely on weekly status emails
- **Internal Optimization**: Free up 96 PM hours monthly for strategic work vs. reporting
- **Client Retention**: Improve client satisfaction scores from 52 to 75+ NPS
- **Revenue Protection**: Avoid milestone penalties through proactive risk management
- **Automation Platform**: Create foundation for future AI-powered project insights and predictive analytics

## Expected Outcomes

### Business Outcomes
- **40% reduction** in PM time spent on status reporting (from 7 hours/week to 4 hours/week)
- **25% decrease** in project deadline overruns (from 23% to 17% or less)
- **Zero** unescalated critical risks reaching issue status
- **Real-time** executive visibility into portfolio health (vs. 3-5 day lag)
- **Client-ready** project dashboards for external stakeholder transparency

### Technical Outcomes
- Single web-based dashboard accessible to all PMs and leadership
- Integration with existing Jira API for task data synchronization
- Automated risk scoring and prioritization algorithm
- Mobile-responsive interface for on-the-go access
- Automated daily email summaries for overdue tasks and high risks

### Organizational Outcomes
- Standardized project tracking methodology across all project teams
- Improved cross-project resource visibility to prevent conflicts
- Enhanced decision-making through data visualization and trend analysis
- Increased PM confidence with proactive, data-backed risk management
- Foundation for PMO maturity advancement (currently Level 2, targeting Level 3)
