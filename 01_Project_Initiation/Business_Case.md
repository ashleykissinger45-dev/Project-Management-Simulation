## Problem Statement

### Current Situation

There is a growing need for practical, hands-on tools that combine technical web development skills with real-world project management competencies. Current educational resources often treat these as separate disciplines, creating a gap in comprehensive learning materials.

### Business Need

- **Skills Gap**: Students and professionals need integrated learning experiences that mirror actual workplace scenarios
- **Portfolio Development**: Job seekers require portfolio projects demonstrating both technical and organizational capabilities
- **Training Materials**: Educational institutions need realistic simulations for teaching project management

### Opportunity

Create an interactive web-based dashboard that serves as both a learning tool and a functional project management system, providing hands-on experience with:
- Modern web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Professional project management practices (PMI/PMBOK standards)
- Version control and collaboration workflows (Git/GitHub)
- Real-world PM documentation and artifacts

---

## Proposed Solution

### Solution Overview

Develop an Interactive Project Management Simulation Dashboard that includes:

1. **Web-Based Dashboard Application**
   - Task tracking and management
   - Team member profiles and role assignments  - Risk identification and monitoring
   - Progress reporting and metrics visualization
   - Responsive, mobile-friendly design

2. **Complete PM Documentation Suite**
   - All standard PMI knowledge area documents
   - Templates following industry best practices
   - Realistic sample data and scenarios

3. **Educational Framework**
   - Structured learning path (beginner to advanced)
   - Role-based simulations (PM, BA, Developer, Designer, QA)
   - Integration with real workflows (Git, agile practices)

### Key Features

- ✅ Interactive dashboard with real-time updates
