## Lessons Learned Register

### Initiation Phase

#### Lesson #001: Realistic Team Simulation Design

**Date**: February 7, 2026  
**Phase**: Initiation  
**Category**: Process / Methodology  
**Status**: Active

**Situation**:
Setting up a simulated project team with distinct personas for an educational PM simulation project.

**What Went Well**:
- Creating detailed persona profiles with unique communication styles adds realism
- Having a Senior Developer, Backend Developer, Designer, and QA Engineer covers all essential roles
- Documenting team profiles upfront provides clear role expectations

**What Could Be Improved**:
- TBD as we proceed with the simulation

**Recommendations**:
- Consider adding more specialized roles for complex projects (e.g., DevOps, Security)
- Document communication patterns and decision-making authority clearly
- Create persona "playbooks" for consistency in interactions

**Impact**: Positive - Enhances learning experience

---

#### Lesson #002: PMI-Standard Documentation Structure

**Date**: February 7, 2026  
**Phase**: Initiation  
**Category**: Documentation  
**Status**: Active

**Situation**:
Organizing project documentation following PMI/PMBOK standards with professional folder structure.

**What Went Well**:
- Comprehensive folder structure covering all 10 PM knowledge areas
- Clear numbering system for navigation
- Separation of concerns (Initiation, Planning, Execution, etc.)
- Professional templates for all major documents

**What Could Be Improved**:
- Could add more cross-referencing between related documents
- Consider adding quick-reference index

**Recommendations**:
- Maintain consistency in document formatting across all files
- Use a central index/README within each folder
- Regular audits to ensure documentation stays current

**Impact**: Positive - Improves project organization and professionalism

## Best Practices Identified

1. **Documentation First**: Create comprehensive documentation structure before execution
2. **Role Clarity**: Define roles and responsibilities explicitly (RACI matrix)
3. **Professional Standards**: Follow industry standards (PMI/PMBOK) for credibility
4. **Version Control**: Use Git from day one for all project artifacts
5. **Realistic Simulation**: Detailed personas enhance educational value

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scope Creep**: Clearly define scope boundaries early
2. **Documentation Lag**: Keep documentation current, don't leave for "later"
3. **Communication Gaps**: Establish clear communication channels and protocols
4. **Quality Shortcuts**: Don't sacrifice quality for speed
5. **Ignoring Risks**: Proactive risk management from the start

2. **Regular retrospectives**: Frequent reflection and adaptation
3. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive, current documentation
4. **Communication**: Over-communicate rather than under-communicate
5. **Realistic estimating**: Build in buffers for unknowns

### Do Less Of:

1. *To be identified as project progresses*

### Start Doing:

1. *To be identified as project progresses*

### Stop Doing:

1. *To be identified as project progresses*
