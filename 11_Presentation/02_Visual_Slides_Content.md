## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE
**Visual:** SprintLab logo (🚀) large and centered, gradient background

```
🚀 SprintLab
Agentic AI-Powered Project Management

Ashley Kissinger | Product Manager
TechFlow Solutions | February 2026
```

**Speaker Notes:** "Welcome! Today I'm showing you how AI is changing project management from an administrative burden to strategic leadership."

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Visual:** Split screen - Left side shows overwhelmed PM buried in paperwork, Right side shows clock ticking to deadline

```
THE PM REALITY CHECK

⏱️ 40% of our time = Admin work
   • Status reports
   • Risk logs
   • Backlog grooming
   • Stakeholder emails

📉 Result:
   • Reactive, not proactive
   • Risks blindside us
   • Team needs attention we can't give
   • Strategic work gets pushed aside
```

**Speaker Notes:** "PMs spend 15-20 hours per week on tasks a smart assistant could handle. That's half our job."

---

## SLIDE 3: MY PROJECT (CONTEXT)
**Visual:** Dashboard screenshot with key metrics highlighted

```
REAL PROJECT: Smart Task & Risk Dashboard

💰 Budget:     $85,000
📅 Timeline:   12 weeks (Feb 10 - May 1, 2026)
👥 Team:       5 cross-functional members
📊 Scope:      240 story points across 7 epics
🎯 Deadline:   Hard stop for $2M client demo

METHOD: Agile/Scrum | 6 two-week sprints
RISK:   High visibility, zero room for error
```

**Speaker Notes:** "This is my actual project - not a demo. Real stakes, real team, real deadline. Perfect testbed for AI assistance."

---

## SLIDE 4: WHAT IS AGENTIC AI?
**Visual:** Flowchart showing AI capabilities with icons

```
AGENTIC AI = Autonomous + Intelligent

Traditional AI:              Agentic AI:
❌ Answers questions         ✅ Anticipates needs
❌ Follows commands          ✅ Takes initiative
❌ One-off responses         ✅ Continuous monitoring
❌ No context memory         ✅ Learns from project history

🧠 CAPABILITIES:
   1. Analyze project health autonomously
   2. Generate PM deliverables
   3. Simulate stakeholder interactions
   4. Provide decision support with consequences
   5. Learn from past sprints
```

**Speaker Notes:** "Agentic AI doesn't wait for commands - it acts within guardrails you set. It's a co-pilot, not a tool."

---

## SLIDE 5: BEFORE vs AFTER AI (TIME SAVINGS)
**Visual:** Two pie charts side by side

```
MY WEEK: BEFORE AI (40 hrs)

Admin/Documentation:   16 hrs (40%) 🔴
Meetings/Standups:     10 hrs (25%) 🟡
Strategic Work:         8 hrs (20%) 🟢
Team Support:           6 hrs (15%) 🔵

---

MY WEEK: WITH AI (40 hrs)

Admin/Documentation:    5 hrs (12%) 🔴  [AI handles routine]
Meetings/Standups:      8 hrs (20%) 🟡  [AI preps agendas]
Strategic Work:        17 hrs (43%) 🟢  [More time!]
Team Support:          10 hrs (25%) 🔵  [Better coaching]

⚡ TIME SAVED: 11 hrs/week = 132 hrs over 12 weeks
💰 VALUE: $6,600 saved (at $50/hr billing rate)
```

**Speaker Notes:** "AI doesn't eliminate work - it eliminates low-value repetitive work so I can focus on strategy and people."

---

## SLIDE 6: BEFORE vs AFTER AI (RISK PREVENTION)
**Visual:** Timeline with risk flags appearing earlier with AI

```
RISK DETECTION: BEFORE vs AFTER

WITHOUT AI:
📅 Week 2: Risk appears in project
📅 Week 3: Team mentions it in standup
📅 Week 4: Risk becomes blocker
📅 Week 5: Emergency mitigation (costly)

💸 Impact: 
   • 1 sprint delayed
   • $12K budget overrun
   • Team morale hit

---

WITH AI:
📅 Week 1: AI detects early warning signals
📅 Week 2: AI flags risk with mitigation options
📅 Week 2: Proactive action taken
📅 Week 3+: Risk avoided

💰 Impact:
   • $0 overrun
   • On schedule
   • Team confidence high

🎯 RESULT: 3-5 day early warning on risks
```

**Speaker Notes:** "AI constantly monitors patterns humans miss. It flagged my Jira API delay 2 days before it became critical."

---

## SLIDE 7: BEFORE vs AFTER AI (DECISION QUALITY)
**Visual:** Decision tree with multiple branches showing outcomes

```
DECISION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

EXAMPLE: Resource Conflict Mid-Sprint

WITHOUT AI:
   • Gut feeling decision
   • No data on consequences
   • Hope for the best

OUTCOMES (actual):
   ❌ 60% of time: Wrong call, sprint fails
   ⚠️  30% of time: OK call, partial success
   ✅ 10% of time: Right call, nail it

---

WITH AI:
   • Simulates 3 options with data
   • Shows impact on budget, timeline, team
   • Recommends best path with rationale

OUTCOMES (AI-assisted):
   ❌ 10% of time: Wrong call
   ⚠️  20% of time: OK call
   ✅ 70% of time: Right call

📈 6x improvement in optimal decisions
```

**Speaker Notes:** "AI doesn't make decisions for me - it gives me data-driven options so I make better calls."

---

## SLIDE 8: LIVE DEMO - WHAT YOU'LL SEE
**Visual:** Screenshot of VS Code with Copilot chat panel

```
🎬 LIVE DEMONSTRATION

1. 🏥 PROJECT HEALTH ANALYSIS
   AI analyzes 8 tasks, 4 risks, 5 team members
   → Real-time risk prioritization

2. ✍️ AUTONOMOUS DOCUMENT GENERATION
   AI drafts stakeholder communication
   → 20 minutes of work in 10 seconds

3. 🎮 INTERACTIVE DECISION SCENARIO
   You choose: cut scope, add resources, or extend deadline?
   → See consequences before you commit

4. 📊 WOW MOMENT
   AI simulates tomorrow's standup

---

## SLIDE 10: WHAT AI CAN'T DO (IMPORTANT)
**Visual:** Red X icons over tasks AI shouldn't handle

```
AI LIMITATIONS - WHERE HUMANS STILL WIN

❌ Navigate organizational politics
   → AI doesn't understand power dynamics

❌ Read room emotion/morale
   → AI can't sense team tension in standups

❌ Make ethical trade-offs
   → AI can't weigh stakeholder impact on people

❌ Build genuine relationships
   → AI can't grab coffee with a sponsor

❌ Handle ambiguous strategy
   → AI needs clear goals to optimize

🧠 AI = Augmented Intelligence, not Artificial Autonomy
   "I review everything before it goes to stakeholders"
```

**Speaker Notes:** "AI is a tool, not a replacement. It handles repetitive work so I can focus on the human elements of PM."

---

## SLIDE 11: HOW TO GET STARTED
**Visual:** Step-by-step roadmap with checkboxes

```
YOUR PATH TO AI-ASSISTED PM

WEEK 1: Setup
   □ Install GitHub Copilot ($10-20/mo)
   □ Connect to your project repo
   □ Add project context (charters, backlogs)

WEEK 2: Learn
   □ Start with simple tasks (generate meeting notes)
   □ Get comfortable with prompts
   □ Review AI outputs carefully

WEEK 3+: Scale
   □ Automate routine deliverables
   □ Use AI for risk analysis
   □ Train AI on your project patterns

🎯 GOAL: 5-10 hrs saved/week within 1 month
```

**Speaker Notes:** "You don't need a data science degree. If you can use VS Code and write clear instructions, you can use agentic AI."

## BONUS SLIDE 13: FAQ
**Visual:** Q&A format with icons

```
COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: "What if AI makes a mistake?"
A: I review everything before it goes to stakeholders. AI drafts, I approve.

Q: "Does this work for non-tech projects?"
A: Yes! AI learns from YOUR project files. Construction, marketing, events - all work.

Q: "Will AI replace PMs?"
A: No. AI handles admin work. PMs focus on strategy, people, stakeholder relationships.

Q: "What about data security?"
A: Use enterprise Copilot with data privacy controls. Your code never trains public models.

Q: "How long to see ROI?"
A: Most PMs save 3-5 hours in the first week. Full benefit (10+ hrs) by month 2.
