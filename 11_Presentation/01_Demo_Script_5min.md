# SprintLab: Agentic AI-Powered PM Demo Script (5 Minutes)

## 🎯 HOOK (30 seconds)
**[Open with dashboard on screen at localhost:8000]**

"What if your PM assistant could work 24/7, never forget a stakeholder update, predict risks before they happen, and handle 40% of your admin work autonomously? 

I'm Ashley, and I've been using agentic AI to manage this $85,000 project with 5 team members, 240 story points, and a hard deadline 10 weeks away. Let me show you what it looks like when AI becomes your intelligent project co-pilot."

## 🚀 DEMO PART 1: Live Project Health Analysis (90 seconds)
**[Show SprintLab dashboard with live data]**

**YOU SAY:** 
"This is my actual project dashboard for TechFlow Solutions. We're building a Smart Task & Risk Dashboard. Right now, we're in Pre-Sprint 1, wrapping up planning."

**[Click to GitHub Copilot in VS Code - have it open to your project]**

**YOU TYPE IN CHAT:** 
"Analyze my current project health. What risks should I be concerned about today?"

**[AI RESPONDS in real-time - this is your WOW moment #1]**

**Expected AI Response:**
- ⚠️ **Critical:** Jira API access expires TODAY (Feb 12) - Jordan blocked
- ⚠️ **High:** Sam (Designer) only 50% allocated - UI wireframes at risk
- ⚠️ **Medium:** No technical architecture doc yet - Sprint 1 starts in 2 days
- ✅ **Good:** Charter, Business Case, Stakeholder Register complete

**YOU SAY:**
"See that? AI just analyzed 8 open tasks, 4 active risks, and my team's workload - and gave me prioritized action items. No spreadsheet digging, no manual status checks. It's proactive, not reactive."

## 💡 DEMO PART 2: Autonomous Document Generation (90 seconds)
**[Keep VS Code visible]**

**YOU SAY:**
"Now watch AI generate a PM deliverable autonomously."

**YOU TYPE IN CHAT:**
"Create a Communication Log entry for a tough conversation: Sarah Chen (sponsor) just emailed asking why we're 2 days behind on API access. Draft my response that addresses her concern while escalating to IT."

**[AI GENERATES in real-time]**

**Expected AI Response:**
```
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**From:** Ashley Kissinger → Sarah Chen
**Type:** Email - Risk Escalation
**Subject:** RE: Jira API Access Delay - Action Plan

Hi Sarah,

You're right to flag this. Our Jira API access was supposed to be ready Feb 10, and we're now 2 days behind, blocking Jordan's integration work.

**What happened:** IT Security review took longer than expected due to data governance questions.

**Impact:** If not resolved by Feb 14, Sprint 1 velocity drops 15-20% (3 stories at risk).

**My action:** 
- Escalated to Tim Brooks (IT Director) this morning
- Set up emergency call for 2pm today with you, Tim, and Jordan
- Backup plan: Use mock data for Sprint 1, real integration in Sprint 2

I'll send call details in 10 minutes. Can you join?

- Ashley
```

**YOU SAY:**
"AI understands stakeholder management, technical dependencies, escalation protocols, AND my project timeline. It drafted this in 10 seconds. Manually? That's 20 minutes of carefully wording an escalation email."

## 🎮 DEMO PART 3: Interactive Decision Scenario (90 seconds)
**[Open Interactive_Scenario.html file you created]**

**YOU SAY:**
"Let's make this interactive. You're the PM. You have to decide: Do you cut scope, add resources, or extend timeline when a risk hits?"

**[Walk through the interactive scenario - audience sees branching paths]**

**SCENARIO:**
"It's Week 4. Jamie (Backend Dev) just got pulled to a production emergency for 1 week. You have 13 story points in-flight. What do you do?"

**OPTIONS:**
1. **Cut scope** → AI shows: Sprint fails, team morale drops, but deadline holds
2. **Add contractor** → AI shows: $8K over budget, but sprint completes, delays next sprint planning
3. **Extend deadline** → AI shows: Sarah Chen escalates to exec team, project confidence drops

**[Click through one path - show consequences]**

**YOU SAY:**
"AI doesn't just give advice - it simulates outcomes. It knows my budget constraints ($85K), team dynamics, stakeholder tolerances, and historical data. This is decision support with consequences."

## 📊 DEMO PART 4: Before/After Metrics (60 seconds)
**[Show slides or metrics visual]**

**YOU SAY:**
"Here's the ROI story. Before AI, I spent 40% of my week on admin tasks:"

**BEFORE AI:**
- ⏱️ **12 hours/week:** Manual status reports, risk logs, backlog grooming
- 📧 **47 emails/week:** Stakeholder updates, team check-ins
- 🔥 **3-4 surprises/sprint:** Risks that blindsided me
- 📉 **Reactive:** Always catching up

**AFTER AI:**
- ⏱️ **5 hours/week:** AI handles routine deliverables, I review/approve
- 📧 **18 emails/week:** AI drafts, I personalize and send
- 🔥 **0-1 surprises/sprint:** AI flags risks 3-5 days early
- 📈 **Proactive:** Focus on strategy, stakeholder relationships, team development

**TIME SAVED:** 7 hours/week = 28 hours/month = **70 hours saved over this 12-week project**

**YOU SAY:**
"That's almost 2 full work weeks I get back to focus on what humans do best: build relationships, make strategic calls, coach my team."

## 🎆 WOW MOMENT FINALE (30 seconds)
**[Return to VS Code]**

**YOU TYPE:**
"Simulate tomorrow's daily standup. Predict what each team member will say based on current task status, risk log, and communication history."

**[AI GENERATES 5 realistic standup updates]**

**Expected AI Response:**
- **Jordan:** "Blocked on API access still. Tim Brooks call at 2pm. Working on mock data setup as backup."
- **Jamie:** "Backend architecture doc 80% done. Reviewing database schema with Jordan when he's unblocked."
- **Sam:** "UI wireframes for Task Dashboard ready for review. Need feedback by Friday to stay on track."
- **Riley:** "Setting up test environments. Waiting on dev environment from Jamie - ETA?"
- **Ashley (You):** "Escalating API blocker with Sarah and Tim today. Sprint 1 planning Friday still on track."

**YOU SAY:**
"This is agentic AI - it doesn't just answer questions, it anticipates needs, connects dots across documents, and acts autonomously within guardrails I set. 

**The future of PM isn't AI replacing us - it's AI amplifying us.** We become strategic leaders instead of administrative workers."

## 🙋 Q&A TRANSITION (10 seconds)
"This is all real - my actual project, live dashboard, real AI interactions. Want to see more? Ask me anything about how this works behind the scenes."

---

## 📌 BACKUP TALKING POINTS (If Extra Time)

### How does it work technically?
"GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4.5 model, trained on project context. It reads my project files, learns patterns, and can execute tasks autonomously within VS Code."

### What can't AI do?
"AI can't replace human judgment on stakeholder politics, team morale issues, or ethical trade-offs. It's a tool, not a decision-maker."

### How much does it cost?
"GitHub Copilot: $10-20/month. ROI: If it saves 7 hours/week at $50/hr, that's $350/week saved. Pays for itself in 2 days."

### What if AI makes a mistake?
"I review everything before it goes to stakeholders. AI drafts, I approve. It's augmented intelligence, not artificial autonomy."
