## Budget Risk Assessment

### Potential Budget Risks

1. **Personnel overruns**: Estimated hours may exceed projections
   - **Mitigation**: Track hours weekly, adjust scope if needed

2. **Tool costs**: Subscription pricing may increase
   - **Mitigation**: Lock in annual rates where possible

3. **Scope changes**: Additional requirements may increase costs
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain contingency fund, implement change control

### Contingency Plan

- **5% Contingency Reserve**: $5,000 available for unexpected costs
- **Approval Required**: Any expense >$500 requires PM approval
- **Change Order Process**: Scope changes require budget impact assessment

## Financial Controls

### Approval Authority

- **$500-$2,000**: Steering Committee
- **>$2,000**: Executive Sponsor

### Reporting Frequency

- **Weekly**: Internal team budget review
- **Bi-weekly**: Stakeholder financial update
- **Monthly**: Formal budget variance report
