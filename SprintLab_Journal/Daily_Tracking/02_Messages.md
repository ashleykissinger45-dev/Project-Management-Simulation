### Thursday, February 13, 2026 - TODAY

**#smart-task-dashboard channel:**

```
[8:45 AM] Jordan Martinez: Morning! Quick heads up - I'll be 5 mins late to standup. Wrapping up a commit.

[11:20 AM] Jordan Martinez: @Ashley - Do you have the API design doc ready? Want to review before I build out more UI components.

[11:25 AM] Jamie Park: Yeah! Google Doc link: [link] - covers all endpoints, request/response formats, error codes.

[11:30 AM] Jordan Martinez: Perfect, reviewing now

[1:45 PM] Jordan Martinez: That workshop was super insightful! The "6 hours of manual reporting" pain point is real.

[1:48 PM] Jamie Park: Yeah, one PM said he spends all Friday afternoon copy-pasting data from Jira to Excel. We can totally eliminate that.
