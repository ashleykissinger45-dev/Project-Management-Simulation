**Subject:** Project Charter Approved - Let's Launch!  
**Date:** Monday, February 10 at 8:15 AM  
**Priority:** High

Hi Ashley,

Great news! David and I have both signed the Project Charter. You're officially authorized to proceed with the Smart Task & Risk Dashboard project. 

I'm excited to see this come together. The $2M client bid depends on us demonstrating real-time project visibility by end of March, so the beta release on 3/31 is critical.

Let's meet Friday at 3 PM for our first weekly check-in. I'll want to see progress on requirements and initial sprint planning.

Looking forward to working with you on this!

Sarah Chen  
VP of Delivery Operations

Ashley,

Congratulations on getting charter approval! As PMO Director, I want to make sure we're aligned on documentation standards for your project.

Required PMO deliverables:
- ✅ Project Charter (received - excellent work)
- ⏳ Business Case with ROI analysis (due by end of planning phase)
- ⏳ Stakeholder Register with power/interest grid (ASAP)
- ⏳ Risk Log (initial risks by end of Week 1)
- ⏳ Weekly status reports every Friday by 5 PM
- ⏳ Quality Management Plan (before Sprint 2)

All docs should follow our PMI/PMBOK templates. Let me know if you need any guidance.

**Subject:** Ready to kick off - Tech questions  
**Date:** Monday, February 10 at 10:45 AM  
**Priority:** Normal

Hey Ashley,

Jamie and I are pumped to get started! Few quick questions before we dive in:

1. **Tech stack decision**: Python Flask or Java Spring Boot for backend? I'm leaning Python since we can iterate faster, but want your call.

2. **Jira API access**: Do we have the OAuth credentials yet? I'll need those by end of this week to start integration work in Sprint 1.

3. **Dev environment**: Should we set up local PostgreSQL or use AWS RDS from the start?

4. **Sprint cadence**: Assuming 2-week sprints starting today (Feb 10-21), with sprint planning meeting this afternoon?

Let me know so Jamie and I can get our environments ready.

**Date:** Tuesday, February 11 at 11:20 AM  
**Priority:** Normal

Ashley,

Received your IT service desk ticket #4521 for Jira REST API access. We'll need:

1. Formal request form completed (attached)
2. Security review approval from Maya Patel
3. Scope of API usage documented
4. Rate limit requirements (standard is 1000 calls/hour)

Processing time: 3-5 business days after all requirements submitted.

I can fast-track this if Sarah Chen confirms it's project-critical. Can you have her email me directly?

**Date:** Tuesday, February 11 at 2:15 PM  
**Priority:** Normal

Hi Ashley,

Heard through the grapevine about the new dashboard project! I'm assigned as the UI/UX designer for 2 weeks. 

When do you need me? I'm wrapping up another project this week, so I can jump in next Monday (Feb 17) for the design sprint.

Would love to see the requirements doc and maybe sit in on a user interview with the 12 PMs who'll be using this. User-centered design is critical!

Let me know the plan.

**Subject:** Technical Architecture Review - Schedule  
**Date:** Wednesday, February 12 at 9:00 AM  
**Priority:** Normal

Ashley,

Glad to see this project moving forward. As CTO, I'll need to review and approve the technical architecture before any major development begins.

Please have Jordan prepare:
- System architecture diagram
- Technology stack justification
- Security approach (SSO integration, data encryption)
- Scalability plan (we're growing to 25 projects soon)
- AWS infrastructure requirements

Let's schedule a 1-hour tech review meeting for Friday, Feb 21 at 2 PM. That should give you time to finalize requirements first.

CTO

**Subject:** ⚠️ Jira API Security Review Required  
**Date:** Wednesday, February 12 at 3:45 PM  
**Priority:** High

Ashley,

IT Operations forwarded your Jira API access request to Security for review. We take third-party API integrations seriously due to SOC 2 compliance.

**Required for approval:**
- [ ] Data flow diagram showing what Jira data you're accessing
- [ ] Confirmation API access is READ-ONLY (no write operations)
- [ ] OAuth 2.0 authentication approach documented
- [ ] API rate limiting strategy
- [ ] Error handling for API failures
- [ ] PII data handling plan (if any)

**Timeline:** Security review takes 5-7 business days after documentation submitted.

**CRITICAL:** I see your beta release is March 31. If Jira integration is on critical path, we need this documentation by **Friday, Feb 14** to avoid delays.

Can we schedule 30 minutes tomorrow to expedite this?

Maya Patel  
IT Security & Compliance Manager

**Subject:** QA Resources - When do you need me?  
**Date:** Thursday, February 13 at 8:30 AM  
**Priority:** Normal

Hey Ashley,

I'm assigned as QA for the dashboard project (3 weeks allocated). Quick questions:

1. When does UAT start? (I assume April based on project timeline?)
2. Do we have a test plan yet or should I start creating one?
3. Will there be automated tests or just manual testing?
4. Who's writing the acceptance criteria for user stories?

I'm finishing up testing on the PaymentPro project this week, so I'll have bandwidth starting next Monday.

Let me know how you want to structure QA for this project!

QA Engineer

**Subject:** Backend API Design - Ready for Review  
**Date:** Thursday, February 13 at 11:00 AM  
**Priority:** Normal

Ashley,

I've been working on the initial API design for the dashboard backend. Here's what I'm thinking:

**REST API Endpoints:**
- GET /api/tasks - Fetch all tasks
- GET /api/tasks/{id} - Get specific task
- GET /api/risks - Fetch all risks
- POST /api/risks - Create new risk
- GET /api/resources - Get resource allocation
- GET /api/dashboard/executive - Portfolio view

**Database schema** includes tables for: Projects, Tasks, Risks, Resources, Users

I've documented everything in a Google Doc. Can we review this in tomorrow's standup? Want to make sure I'm aligned with requirements before I start coding.

Also - any word on that Jira API access? That's blocking my work on the integration module.
