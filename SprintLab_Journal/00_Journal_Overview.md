## 🎯 Project Goals

**Business Problem:**
TechFlow's 12 PMs use fragmented tools causing 23% deadline overruns, $150K in penalties, and resource conflicts.

**Solution:**
Smart Task & Risk Dashboard - unified platform with:
- Real-time task tracking with Jira sync
- Resource allocation and conflict detection
- Risk management with automated scoring
- Executive portfolio dashboard
- Automated notifications

**Success Criteria:**
- Dashboard deployed by May 1, 2026
- 100% PM adoption (12/12 PMs)
- 40% reduction in admin time (7 hrs → 4 hrs/week)
- Zero unescalated critical risks
- Client NPS improvement (52 → 75+)

## 📚 Simulation Learning Objectives

**What I'm Practicing:**
- ✅ Agile/Scrum project management in real scenarios
- ✅ Stakeholder management with competing interests
- ✅ Sprint planning, execution, and velocity tracking
- ✅ Risk identification and proactive mitigation
- ✅ Team coordination and conflict resolution
- ✅ Technical decision-making as a non-technical PM
- ✅ Status reporting and executive communication
- ✅ Learning from consequences (good and bad)

**Simulation Rules:**
- All meetings after 5 PM (school schedule compatibility)
- Realistic team personas with authentic technical opinions
- Actions have real, cumulative consequences
- Stakeholders react based on my communication and decisions
- No hand-holding unless I ask "As a mentor, what should I consider?"
- Complications introduced realistically (sick days, scope creep, etc.)
