## Appendix: Retrospective Techniques

### Ideas for Future Retrospectives

1. **Start/Stop/Continue** - Simple categorization of practices
2. **4Ls** - Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For
3. **Sailboat** - What's propelling us? What's anchoring us? What are the risks?
4. **Mad/Sad/Glad** - Emotions about the sprint
5. **Timeline** - Map events chronologically and discuss highs/lows
6. **5 Whys** - Deep dive into root causes
7. **Speed Car** - What accelerates us? What slows us down?
8. **Starfish** - Start, Stop, Continue, More Of, Less Of
