## Icebox / Future Enhancements

**From Sponsor (Explicitly Out of Scope for Phase 1):**

| ID | Description | Reason for Deferral |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| ICE-001 | AI-powered predictive analytics | Budget constraint, Phase 2 consideration |
| ICE-002 | Client-facing external portal | Security review required (4 weeks), deferred to Phase 2 |
| ICE-003 | Confluence integration | Not critical for MVP, Phase 2 |
| ICE-004 | Slack notifications | Focus on email first, assess adoption before adding |
| ICE-005 | Mobile native apps (iOS/Android) | Resource constraint, responsive web sufficient for Phase 1 |
| ICE-006 | Custom report builder | Complex feature, standard reports sufficient for launch |
| ICE-007 | Time tracking/timesheet module | Out of scope per sponsor direction |
| ICE-008 | Budget/financial tracking | Finance system integration complex, future phase |
