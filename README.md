# � SprintLab: The Agile Project Management Experience

**Current Project**: Smart Task & Risk Dashboard for TechFlow Solutions

An immersive, hands-on Agile project management simulation where you act as the Project Manager for a real-world software development initiative. Manage sprints, coordinate a development team, track user stories, mitigate risks, and deliver a production dashboard—all following professional PMI/PMBOK standards and Scrum methodology.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**You are**: Ashley Kissinger, Project Manager at TechFlow Solutions  
**Your Mission**: Deliver a Smart Task & Risk Dashboard to consolidate project tracking and eliminate fragmented PM tools causing 23% deadline overruns

**Project Details**:
- **Company**: TechFlow Solutions (250-employee software consulting firm)
- **Budget**: $85,000
- **Timeline**: 12 weeks (Feb 10 - May 1, 2026)
- **Methodology**: Agile/Scrum with 2-week sprints
- **Team**: 2 Developers (Jordan Martinez, Jamie Park), 1 Designer (Sam Kim), 1 QA (Riley Thompson)
- **Sponsor**: Sarah Chen, VP of Delivery Operations
- **Success Criteria**: Dashboard deployed, 100% PM adoption, 40% reduction in admin time, zero unescalated critical risks

## 💼 The Business Problem

TechFlow's 12 project managers currently use fragmented tools (Excel, Jira, email) to track tasks, resources, and risks. This inefficiency has resulted in:

- **23% increase** in deadline overruns (Q4 2025)
- **$150K in penalty fees** from missed project milestones
- **Resource conflicts**: Double-booking incidents across projects
- **6-8 hours/week** PM time spent on manual status reporting
- **Critical risks** becoming issues due to delayed escalation
- **Client NPS score of 52** (target: 75+)

Your dashboard will provide a single source of truth with real-time visibility, automated Jira task sync, risk scoring algorithms, and executive portfolio views.

**Total**: 240 story points across 6 sprints

## 💡 What You'll Experience

### Agile/Scrum Ceremonies You'll Run
- ✅ **Sprint Planning** (every 2 weeks): Select user stories, estimate, commit
- ✅ **Daily Standups** (daily): Team updates, blockers, progress
- ✅ **Sprint Reviews** (end of sprint): Demo completed work
- ✅ **Sprint Retrospectives** (end of sprint): Process improvements
- ✅ **Backlog Grooming** (mid-sprint): Refine upcoming stories

### Project Management Skills You'll Practice
- ✅ Stakeholder management and communication
- ✅ Sprint planning and backlog prioritization
- ✅ Risk identification and mitigation
- ✅ Team coordination and conflict resolution
- ✅ Status reporting and executive communication
- ✅ Scope management and change control
- ✅ Quality assurance and Definition of Done
- ✅ Velocity tracking and burndown charts
- ✅ Budget monitoring and resource allocation

### Technical Skills You'll Develop
*This simulation emphasizes PM-level technical understanding, not advanced coding*

- ✅ **Reading technical documentation** (API specs, architecture diagrams)
- ✅ **Understanding tech stacks** (frontend/backend/database distinctions)
- ✅ **Basic Git operations** (commit, push, pull - track project documents)
- ✅ **Reviewing mockups & wireframes** (UI/UX evaluation)
- ✅ **Facilitating technical discussions** (backend developer vs. designer needs)
- ✅ **Writing technical requirements** (translating business needs to user stories)
- ✅ **Basic HTML/CSS** (understanding what your team is building)
- ✅ **API integration concepts** (how Jira sync works, not building it yourself)
- ✅ **Risk assessment of technical dependencies** (Jira API changes, security vulnerabilities)

**Reality Check**: You're the *Project Manager*, not the developer. Your team (Jordan, Jamie, Sam, Riley) builds the dashboard. You coordinate, prioritize, remove blockers, and make decisions. Any coding you do is minimal—updating documentation, basic HTML prototypes, or simple scripts. Focus on *managing* the technical work, not doing all of it yourself.

## 👤 Who This Is For

- **Aspiring Project Managers**: Get hands-on experience managing a real project without instructions
- **Agile Practitioners**: Practice Scrum ceremonies and agile principles
- **Full-Stack Developers**: Build a complete dashboard application with modern tech stack
- **Career Changers**: Demonstrate both PM and technical skills in one portfolio project
- **Students**: Learn project management by doing, not just reading
- **Portfolio Builders**: Showcase ability to deliver complex projects end-to-end

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

1. **Manage a realistic agile project** from kickoff to deployment
2. **Run authentic Scrum ceremonies** (planning, standups, reviews, retros)
3. **Coordinate a cross-functional team** (dev, design, QA)
4. **Navigate stakeholder expectations** with varying power/interest levels
5. **Make PM decisions autonomously** without step-by-step instructions
6. **Deliver working software** solving a real business problem
7. **Track velocity and burndown** like real agile teams
8. **Handle risks proactively** before they become issues
9. **Document professionally** following PMI/PMBOK standards
10. **Build a portfolio piece** demonstrating multi-disciplinary expertise

## 🤝 Team Simulation

Your team consists of personas with distinct roles and personalities:

- **Jordan Martinez** (Senior Full Stack Developer): 8 years experience, Python/React expert, pragmatic, focuses on clean code
- **Jamie Park** (Backend Developer): 4 years experience, Java specialist, detail-oriented, security-conscious
- **Sam Kim** (UI/UX Designer): 6 years experience, user-centric, collaborative, advocates for simplicity
- **Riley Thompson** (QA Engineer): 5 years experience, thorough, quality-focused, catches edge cases

**Tip**: Use ChatGPT Voice Mode to simulate realistic team meetings and conversations!

## 📊 Project Complexity

This is an **intermediate-to-advanced** simulation:

### Complexity Factors
- 43 user stories across 7 epics (240 story points)
- 14 stakeholders with competing interests
- $85K budget with 15% contingency
- 12-week timeline with hard deadline
- Integration dependencies (Jira API)
- Security requirements (SSO, RBAC)
- Multiple user roles (PM, Executive, Read-only)
- Production deployment expectations

### What Makes It Realistic
- ❌ **No step-by-step instructions** - figure it out like a real PM
- ✅ **Authentic constraints** - budget, timeline, resources
- ✅ **Real dependencies** - waiting on IT Security for API access
- ✅ **Stakeholder pressures** - sponsor wants demo for $2M client
- ✅ **Technical decisions** - Python vs. Java, AWS vs. on-prem
- ✅ **Scope management** - stakeholders will want more features
- ✅ **Risk management** - API downtime, resource availability, security vulnerabilities

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **This is a simulation** - You are the only person, but you manage multiple personas
2. **No external dependencies** - Build what you can, simulate integrations if needed
3. **Focus on PM practice** - The dashboard is secondary to learning project management
4. **Document everything** - Real PMs create extensive documentation
5. **Iterate and improve** - Use retrospectives to enhance your process
6. **It's okay to struggle** - Real projects are complex; figuring it out is the learning

## 🎉 Getting Started Challenge

**Your first PM task**: Review all project documents and prepare for the Sprint 1 planning meeting on February 10, 2026. What user stories will you commit to? How will you organize your first sprint?

**No one will tell you what to do. That's the point. You're the PM.** 🚀
